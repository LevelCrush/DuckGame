# Claude Development Context

This document contains important context and notes for AI assistants (particularly Claude) working on the Duck Game project.

## Project Overview

**Duck Game** is a browser-based clicking game where players hunt ducks within a 30-second time limit. The game features Discord integration for custom assets and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Key Development Guidelines

### Lord Xol's Vision (Updated v2.0)
The game was created under the direction of "Lord Xol" with evolving requirements:

**Original Vision (v1.0):**
- Visceral feedback when ducks are eliminated (blood, feathers, smoke)
- Hit marker sound effects on successful clicks
- Bright red crosshair cursor when hovering over targets
- Integration with Discord assets for enhanced gameplay

**Infernal Expansion (v2.0):**
- Timer extensions (+30s per 15 ducks) for extended gameplay
- Discord hitmarker sound replacing generic beep
- Complete theme transformation to hellfire aesthetic
- Devil emojis replacing clouds
- Taco Bell celebration sound every 5 ducks
- Volume control for loud Discord sounds (default 20%)
- Massive flame wall covering bottom 20% of screen
- Divine spawn effects for bonus ducks (light rays, smoke, feathers)

**Maximum Chaos (v2.1):**
- Duck duplication on EVERY kill (not just every 5)
- Exponential growth formula: each kill spawns 2 more ducks
- Mathematical progression: 1â†’3â†’7â†’15â†’31â†’63â†’127...

**Eternal Chaos (v2.2):**
- Removed 3-second despawn timer completely
- Ducks now remain on screen forever until clicked
- Combined with exponential spawning for ultimate chaos
- Screen inevitably becomes overwhelmed with ducks

### Code Style Preferences
- Keep the game in a **single HTML file** for GitHub Pages deployment
- Use **Web Audio API** for fallback sounds
- Implement **visual effects** using CSS animations
- Maintain **simple, readable code** without unnecessary complexity

### Security Considerations
- **NEVER commit `.env` files** or Discord tokens to the repository
- The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files
- Discord bot tokens and guild IDs must remain private
- Use Base64 encoding for assets when deploying to GitHub Pages

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **index.html** - Single-file game containing:
   - Game logic and state management
   - CSS animations for visual effects
   - Discord asset integration hooks

2. **discord-assets.js** - Module that:
   - Loads Discord emojis, stickers, and sounds
   - Provides fallback mechanisms
   - Manages asset selection and playback

3. **fetch-discord-assets.js** - Node script that:
   - Connects to Discord via bot token
   - Downloads server assets
   - Creates manifest files for web use

### Discord Integration Flow

```
1. Developer runs: npm install
2. Developer configures: .env file with Discord credentials
3. Developer fetches: npm run fetch (downloads Discord assets)
4. Game loads: discord-assets.js module on page load
5. Runtime: Game uses Discord sounds/images if available, falls back to defaults
```

### Asset Storage Strategy

- **Development**: Assets stored as files in `/emojis`, `/sounds`, `/stickers`
- **Production**: Assets embedded as Base64 in manifest.json files
- **Fallback**: Web Audio API and emoji characters when Discord assets unavailable

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Visual Effects
- Add CSS classes in the `<style>` section
- Create elements dynamically in JavaScript
- Use `setTimeout` to clean up DOM elements
- Example: `createSpawnEffect()` for bonus duck spawning

### Modifying Game Mechanics
- Game state variables are at the top of the `<script>` section
- `spawnDuck(x, y, showEffect)` controls duck creation and behavior
  - Now accepts position parameters for targeted spawning
  - `showEffect` boolean triggers spawn animations
- `startGame()` and `endGame()` manage game flow
- `ducksCaught` tracks total for bonuses separate from score

### Updating Discord Integration
- Modify `fetch-discord-assets.js` for fetching logic
- Update `discord-assets.js` for runtime usage
- Use `playSoundByName()` for specific sounds (hitmarker, tbell)
- Test with both Discord assets present and absent
- Volume parameter now propagates through all sound methods

### Managing Game Difficulty (v2.2 - Eternal Chaos)
- Duck spawn interval: 1000ms (1 second)
- Duck duplication: EVERY kill spawns 2 more (exponential growth)
- Duck despawn timer: REMOVED - ducks stay forever (v2.2)
- Taco Bell sound: Every 5 catches (celebration)
- Timer bonus triggers: Every 15 catches (+30 seconds)
- Volume default: 20% (adjustable via slider)
- Mathematical growth: 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 7 â†’ 15 â†’ 31 â†’ 63 â†’ 127 ducks...
- Screen overflow: Inevitable due to no despawning + exponential spawning

## Testing Checklist

When making changes, verify:
- [ ] Game works without Discord assets (fallback mode)
- [ ] Game works with Discord assets loaded
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Visual effects render correctly
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] Score tracking functions properly
- [ ] Timer counts down correctly
- [ ] Game over screen displays

## Performance Considerations

- Limit DOM manipulation during gameplay
- Clean up event listeners and intervals
- Remove visual effect elements after animations
- Use CSS transforms over position changes
- Batch DOM updates when possible

## Recent Updates (v2.2)

### v2.2.0 - Eternal Chaos
- **Duck Persistence**: Removed 3-second despawn timer
- **Infinite Accumulation**: Ducks build up endlessly
- **Code Change**: Removed `setTimeout` for duck removal

### v2.1.0 - Maximum Chaos
- **Exponential Spawning**: Every kill creates 2 new ducks
- **Immediate Duplication**: No delay, instant multiplication
- **Chaos Mathematics**: Geometric progression of duck count

### v2.0.0 - Infernal Update
- **Volume Control**: Slider UI with 0-100% range
- **Infernal Theme**: Complete visual overhaul with fire and devils
- **Spawn Effects**: Multi-layered animation system for bonus ducks
- **Timer Extensions**: Reward system for skilled players
- **Enhanced Sounds**: Discord-specific audio integration

### Technical Improvements Made
- Modified `spawnDuck()` signature for position control
- Added `createSpawnEffect()` for visual feedback
- Enhanced `discord-assets.js` with named sound support
- Implemented `gameVolume` global variable for audio control
- Added boundary checking for spawn positions
- Removed despawn timer in v2.2.0

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Potential features to consider:
- Difficulty levels (speed, spawn rate presets)
- Power-ups or special ducks (golden duck = 5 points?)
- Leaderboard system (local storage or backend)
- Multiple game modes (survival, time attack, zen)
- Background music (Discord integration)
- Achievement system (milestones and badges)
- Mobile touch optimization (larger hit boxes)
- Save system for high scores
- Different duck types with varying point values
- Combo system for consecutive hits
- Screen shake on special events

## Deployment Notes

### GitHub Pages Setup
1. Repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: master, folder: / (root)
4. The game auto-deploys on push to master

### Asset Handling
- Use `USE_BASE64=true` in .env for GitHub Pages
- This embeds assets in manifest files
- Avoids Git LFS requirements
- Works with GitHub's file size limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Discord assets not loading**
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify manifest.json files exist
   - Ensure correct file paths

2. **Sounds not playing**
   - Browser may block autoplay
   - User interaction required first
   - Check volume settings

3. **Performance issues**
   - Too many ducks spawning
   - Memory leaks from unremoved elements
   - Check interval cleanup
